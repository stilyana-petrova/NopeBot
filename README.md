# NopeBot

NopeBotProject is an ASP.NET Core MVC (v8) web application designed to help users manage suspicious messages from unknown senders across multiple platforms (Instagram, Pinterest, Messenger) by generating AI-powered tone-based replies using ChatGPT. Replies are generated based on user-selected tones (Sarcastic, Security Bot, Police Bot) and require user approval before sending. The system follows a secure 3-layer architecture and logs all interactions.

## Usage

- Import messages from connected social media platforms.
- Select a tone for the reply.
- Generate a ChatGPT response.
- Refresh if you want a different reply.
- Approve and copy the response.
- Manually send the reply from your social media account.
- Admin can manage users and delete inappropriate messages.
